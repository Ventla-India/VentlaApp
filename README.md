# VentlaApp

A React Native app built with MVVM architecture, featuring integrated Firebase Crashlytics, Push Notifications, and multi-language support.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

VentlaApp follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** pattern, providing a clean separation of concerns and maintainable codebase.

### MVVM Structure
```

├── utils/                 # Helper functions and utilities
├── viewmodels/            # ViewModels (business logic for views)
└── views/                 # UI Views (screens and components)

   - Run:
     ```sh
     npm run android
     ```

3. **iOS**
   - Ensure `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist` is present (from Firebase Console)
   - Install CocoaPods:
     ```sh
     cd ios && pod install && cd ..
     ```
   - Run:
     ```sh
     npm run ios
     ```

## 🎯 Usage

### MVVM Pattern
- **Models**: Data structures and business entities (`src/models/`)
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management (`src/viewmodels/`)
- **Views**: UI components and screens (`src/views/`)
- **Services**: External integrations and API calls (`src/services/`)

### Crashlytics
- Crashlytics is enabled by default
- To test, use the "Test Crash" button in the app UI
- Crashes will be reported to Firebase Console

### Push Notifications
- FCM token is generated and displayed in the app UI
- To test, send a push notification from the Firebase Console
- Foreground notifications show an in-app alert; background notifications appear in the system tray

### Localization
- Supports multiple languages (English, Swedish, German, French, Spanish, Finnish, Norwegian, Danish)
- Automatically detects device locale
- Language can be changed dynamically

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Features
1. **Create a Model** in `src/models/`
2. **Create a Service** in `src/services/api/`
3. **Create a ViewModel** in `src/viewmodels/`
4. **Create a View** in `src/views/screens/`
5. **Wire up the components**

### State Management
- Use MobX for reactive state management
- ViewModels handle business logic
- Views observe ViewModels for automatic updates

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **No push notifications?**
  - Ensure correct Firebase config files are present
  - Check device internet connection
  - Test on a real device (not emulator/simulator)
- **Crashes not reported?**
  - Confirm Crashlytics is enabled in Firebase Console
  - Check for build errors or missing native setup
- **Language not changing?**
  - Check localization files in `src/assets/locales/`
  - Verify device locale settings
